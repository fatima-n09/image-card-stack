#  Image Card Stack

An interactive image stack component built with React and Motion. Features smooth 3D animations, drag interactions, and a reusable component architecture that can work with any type of stackable content.

##  Tech

- `React `
- `TypeScript`
- `Motion` (Framer Motion successor)
- `Tailwind CSS `
- `Vite `

## üìç The Process

I wanted to create something that felt tactile and fun, like handling real cards. Started with a simple drag concept but realized it needed that extra dimension to feel authentic. The 3D rotations based on drag position make each interaction feel responsive and natural. The generic component design means you can stack anything.. images, content cards, whatever you need. The spring animations give it that satisfying snap-back feeling when you let go. Built the whole thing to be modular, so the core `CardStack` component can be reused while `ImageCardStack` shows how to implement it for specific use cases.

##  Architecture

- **`CardStack<T>`** - Generic draggable stack component accepting any `StackableItem`
- **`DraggableContainer`** - Handles drag physics and 3D motion effects  
- **`useCardRotation`** - Custom hook managing drag interactions and threshold detection
- **`ImageCardStack`** - Concrete implementation for image galleries
- **`StackableItem`** - TypeScript interface ensuring type safety across components
